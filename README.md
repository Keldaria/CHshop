Version 0.4 Patch 1: Universal Bedroom Support + Dorm Temp Fix


----INSTALLATION---- 
Same as any mod for Girl Life, but incase you are unfamiliar

Step 1: Add the CHshop.qsp file to the "mod" folder located with your Girl Life qsp file.
If you do not have a mod folder here, please make one. This should be at the same level as the images folder for your Girl Life game.

Step 2: Launch the game and goto the settings menu. Go to the mods tab and use the "install new mod" option.

Step 3: Type "CHshop" into the popup window and click okay.

Step 4: Go to cheat menu. Go to the "recurrent" tab. Scroll down and enable the Cheat Shop

Step 5: Go to your bedroom and new options should appear.

----CURRENT FEATURES----
All clothing, Purse, Shoe and Coat stores currently in game (regardless if they are available to you yet or not)
Permanent Cosmetic Tattoo's with the ability to remove them and go back to normal makeup.
Electrolysis (Permanent Hair Removal) including the ability to toggle it back off 

----FUTURE PLANNED FEATURES----
Piercings shops.
Tattoo shops.
Future items added to GL that need a visual reference to buy (like new types of clothes)

----FEATURES NOT PLANNED----
Anything currently supported in the existing cheat menu. There really isn't a reason for me to do something that is already supported. This include things like

Making the cheat shops free (give yourself some extra money from the normal cheat menu)
Inhibition overrides for clothing purchases(lower your inhibition in the cheat menu then put it back up again when done)
Things like restoring virginity, there are plenty of options in game and the cheat menu for things like this.
Shops for the pharmacy/grocery (these items are available through the cheat menu)
